Wikipedia TDD:
[Test-driven development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards. Kent Beck, who is credited with having developed or 'rediscovered' the technique, stated in 2003 that TDD encourages simple designs and inspires confidence.[1]

Test-driven development is related to the test-first programming concepts of extreme programming, begun in 1999,[2] but more recently has created more general interest in its own right.[3]

### Pygments Code Blocks

class ExampleTest < Minitest::Test
  def test_truth
    assert_true
  end
end

{% endhighlight %}


To run this file, you run __ ruby example_test.rb __ in the terminal.

{% highlight ruby %}
ruby example_test.rb
{% endhighlight %}
