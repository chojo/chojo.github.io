[Syntax highlighting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting) is a feature that displays source code, in different colors and fonts according to the category of terms. This feature facilitates writing in a structured language such as a programming language or a markup language as both structures and syntax errors are visually distinct. Highlighting does not affect the meaning of the text itself; it is intended only for human readers.

### Pygments Code Blocks

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'minitest/autorun'

class ExampleTest < Minitest::Test
  def test_truth
    assert_true
  end
end

{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight ruby %}
ruby example_test.rb
{% endhighlight %}
Output:
![Minitest_Output]({{ site.url }}/images/minitest.png)
